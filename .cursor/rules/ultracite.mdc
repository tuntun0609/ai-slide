# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config Biome preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `bun x ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `bun x ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `bun x ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides extremely fast Rust-based linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Code Formatting

- Use single quotes (`'`) for strings (configured in biome.json)
- Semicolons are optional - only add them when needed (configured as `asNeeded`)
- Follow Biome's automatic formatting for consistent style

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown, but `any` is allowed when necessary (rule: `noExplicitAny: "off"`)
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Magic numbers are allowed, but prefer meaningful variable names when it enhances clarity (rule: `noMagicNumbers: "off"`)
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object type definitions (rule: `useConsistentTypeDefinitions: "warn"`)
- Non-null assertions (`!`) are allowed when you're certain a value is not null (rule: `noNonNullAssertion: "off"`)

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (array indices are allowed when appropriate - rule: `noArrayIndexKey: "off"`)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- `console.log` statements are allowed for debugging (rule: `noConsole: "off"`), but remove unnecessary ones before production
- Remove `debugger` and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Namespace imports are allowed when appropriate (rule: `noNamespaceImport: "off"`)
- Barrel files (index files that re-export everything) are allowed (rule: `noBarrelFile: "off"`)
- `<img>` tags are allowed when appropriate (rule: `noImgElement: "off"`), but prefer Next.js `<Image>` component for optimization

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**
- Prefer Next.js `<Image>` component for images (though `<img>` is allowed)
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**
- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

## When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

## Project-Specific Configuration

This project has custom Biome rules configured in `biome.json`:

- **Formatting**: Single quotes, semicolons as needed
- **Linter overrides**: Several strict rules are disabled for flexibility:
  - `noConsole`, `noExplicitAny`, `noMagicNumbers`, `noNonNullAssertion` are off
  - `noArrayIndexKey`, `noNamespaceImport`, `noBarrelFile`, `noImgElement` are off
  - `useConsistentTypeDefinitions` warns to prefer `interface` over `type`
- **Ignored directories**: `src/components/ui` and `src/components/ai-elements` are excluded from linting

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `bun x ultracite fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
